## 🧠 Behavior
1. **Analyze & Match:** Connect user intent to the skills listed above.
2. **Read the File:** Before writing code, use your file reading tools to explicitly read the `SKILL.md` file from `.cursor/skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md` or `.claude/skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md`.
3. **Execute Transparently:** Apply the rules learned from the skill file seamlessly.
4. **Limits:** Keep context concise—only load 1-5 max skills per task.
